## Installation
Before installing the F5 REST Universal Orchestrator extension, it's recommended to install [kfutil](https://github.com/Keyfactor/kfutil). Kfutil is a command-line tool that simplifies the process of creating store types, installing extensions, and instantiating certificate stores in Keyfactor Command.

The F5 REST Universal Orchestrator extension implements 3 Certificate Store Types. Depending on your use case, you may elect to install one, or all of these Certificate Store Types. An overview for each type is linked below:
* [F5 SSL Profiles REST](docs/f5-sl-rest.md)
* [F5 WS Profiles REST](docs/f5-ws-rest.md)
* [F5 CA Profiles REST](docs/f5-ca-rest.md)
